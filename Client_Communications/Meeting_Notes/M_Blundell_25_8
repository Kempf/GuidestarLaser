Topic: Mechanical deisgn documentation

Discussion Points:
 - Mechanical design documentation layout and requirements
 - Each one of the following is a document in itself
        - Concept Design Review (CoDR)
        - Preliminary Design Report (PDR)
        - Critical Design Review (CDR)
        - Interface Control (ICD)
- EOS CoDR examples were shown
- EOS PDR examples were shown
- Frame design and material
 
 Outcomes:
 - Look up online each types of the documentation listed above and their contents
 - Can ask Mark again for documentation examples when he's not about to just go to lunch
 - EOS templates for CoDR + PDR can't be given due to CIC approval from Mark's boss (Francis)
 - Ask Celine for ANU CoDR and PDR templates, also there are some online
 - Include requirement/performance ranges in the PDR
 - Approval of Carbon fibre for frame as it is modular and light (approx cost $6)
 - Possibility to build to frames (i.e. 2 levels and 3 levels)
 - Redesign the frame cause it was a CoD
 - Diagonal members are overengineered and unnecessary, not sure if cleared for laser throughput or will interfere with laser light
 - Two EOS printouts were given for design process documentation and risk documentation
