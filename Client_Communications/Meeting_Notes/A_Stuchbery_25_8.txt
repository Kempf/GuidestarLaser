Topic: Telescope Dome Internal Temperature 

Discussion points
- Maximum operating temperature requirement of lasers (maximum dome temperature) (Requirement 1.5.1)

Outcomes
- Report by A. Stuchbery 2015 measured the internal temperature, reaching a peak around 28C, from outside temperature of 36-38C
- Previous team requirements listed a max of 28+/- 2C. Tolerance was added to account for the possibility of a greater external temperature occurring
- Possibly increase to 30+/-2C if it is determined that the previous tolerance was not great enough
