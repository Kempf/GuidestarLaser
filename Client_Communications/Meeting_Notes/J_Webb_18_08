Topic: EOS Laser Requirements

Discussion points:
- EOS laser requirements

Outcomes
- Update to requirements
 - 2.1.1 -> Number of breadboards is no longer certain. 2 breadboards is the most likely scenario
 - 2.1.8 -> One component is required to be placed within 2 metres, rest anywhere, size is likely to be smaller, could be split up into separate packages -> follow up
 - 2.5.4 -> Vibration number is still not certain
 - 2.5.5 -> Air quality is controlled by design of the GSL, no external systems for now, likely out of our scope -> follow up
 - (new) -> Preventing moisture from forming on the EOS GSL
