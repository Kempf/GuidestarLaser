Meeting with James Webb

Topic: EOS Laser Requirements

Main points:

Requirements document
2.1.1 -> Number of breadboards is no longer certain
2.1.8 -> One component is required to be placed within 2 metres, rest anywhere, size is likely to be smaller, could be split up into separate packages -> follow up
2.5.4 -> Vibration number is still not certain
2.5.5 -> Air quality is controlled by design of the GSL, no external systems for now, likely out of our scope -> follow up
      -> Preventing moisture from forming on the EOS GSL
