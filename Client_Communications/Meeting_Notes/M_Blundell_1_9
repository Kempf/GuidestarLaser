Discussion Points:
- Concept Design
- FEA Analysis on the Frame

Outcomes
- Carbon fibre is good just check that the breadboards can fit into the frame easily
- Standoffs on the frame-plate interface were there for a reason check with telescope CAD model as to why
- Make sure to use inserts inside the tubes interfacing with the mounting plate to prevent them from crushing when mounted onto the plate
- Potentially look at Carbon Spars & Tubes in Sydney for cross-sectional members
- Look at using insulated Bondor pannels for enclosure
- Make sure the holes mounting the frame to the backing plate align with the throughput hole for beam transfer optics (BTO)
- FEA on the frame is recommended and software typically is ANSYS
