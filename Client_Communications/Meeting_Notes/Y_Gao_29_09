Topic: The current cooling systems implemented for the EOS GSL

Discussion Questions:
What is the cooling capacity of the systems and the cooling capacity required for the GSL?
What are the cooling systems currently used by the EOS GSL in the lab?
Should the system be liquid-liquid, liquid-air, or a combination?
What sort of water quality is required for the EOS GSL and the chillers?
What are the control systems used for the cooling systems?

Outcomes:
-The EOS GSL is looking at a very low cooling required; alternate design could go
as low as 30-50 W of thermal cooling required
-The oscillators and the amplifiers are likely to require different cooling 
temperatures, any correlation is a pure coincidence and it is unlikely that the
temperatures required would be the same
-Currently being cooled by a combination of termotek and bay voltex (with one 
thermo scientific, which has very low noise) chillers, no heat exchangers present
-A liquid-liquid and liquid-air system would be very difficult to install in the 
dome, recommended that it be a single layer liquid-air system instead
-Different types of water in different chillers: distilled, deionised, 
de-mineralised, opti-shield solution.
-The different components of the laser are likely to require different types of
water
-bay voltex chillers are used because they can use the opti-shield solution
-Specifications for the chillers are sent to the supplier, such as water flow
-The chillers are monitored remotely
