Topic: Cooling system, electrical and communications cables

Discussion topics:
What is the EOS's current cooling system?
Do they have any available cooling for the ANU laser?
What setup of chillers are they planning on/prefer?
Data sheets and specifications for the chillers?
Constraints on the cable wrap?
Constraints on the fibre cable?


Outcomes:
-There is currently nothing for cooling up in the 1.8m telescope right now
-There is a large cooling system throughout the observatory right now with large
liquid-air chillers connected to a network of heat exchangers; this would be very
difficult to connect to the 1.8m telescope
-Rotating water pipes are not possible or provide almost no flow
-For a smaller amount of cooling (less than a few kilowatts) the telescope should
have its own chillers
-Air-liquid chillers should not be directly connected to the laser because it is
not proven that they can maintain temperature stability
-Bay Voltex heat exchangers could be connected to the lasers (one for each
requires temperature setting, these are currently used for the lasers), and
these should be connected to a chiller (or more than one) on the bottom level, 
which can eject the heat into the partially insulted environment preventing it 
from heating up the rest of the dome.
-Recommended chillers (https://koolance.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=150_151)
-Cable wrap goes 8-10 metres around; one side is for electrical cables, other 
side is for communications cables
-Try to minimise the amount of things that go into the cable wrap; copper cables
get damaged by it, but fibre cables are fine
-Try to put any computer or control systems in the moving part of the telescope
instead of through the cable wrap
-igus is the company that built the cable chain, check website for specifications
-Fibre cable could suffer other problems from 40 meter length, ask the laser 
engineers
