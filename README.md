## Contents

1. README (this file)

2. Client Communications: contains all one-way communication with the client, 
including emails and information provided. This does not include the transcripts

priority up until the next update. Periodically updated as work progresses.
	
4. Meeting Minutes: contains minutes for group meetings,
tutorials, and client meetings.

5. Previous Team Work: this directory effectively contains the entirety of the
previous group's repository on this project, to be used as reference material
for our continuation of their work. The readme file within this repository
contains the contents and breakdown, in order to avoid oversaturating this file.

6. Project Requirements: updated in tandem with the "Current Status" directory, 
this contains the evolving project requirements in the main document, as well 
as comments and other updates that do not fit into the "Current Status".
