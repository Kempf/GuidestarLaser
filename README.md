# Guide Star Laser Project

Repository created on: 04/08/2017

The goal of the project is to develop a preliminary design for mounting the EOS and ANU guide star lasers on the EOS 1.8m telescope at Mt. Stromlo. 
The telescope is used for **laser-tracking satellites** and **space debris**, but its accuracy is limited by the **atmospheric distortions**. A laser guide star (produced by a **guide star laser**, which excites the sodium layer in the atmosphere)
can be used to correct the atmospheric distortions using **adaptive optics** on the telescope. Two such guide star lasers (GSLs) are currently being made for the telescope.

*"Responsibilities" are the areas for which the team member is the key source of knowledge.
All team members will contribute to related project tasks as required.

## Contents

* `Client Communications`: contains all one-way communication with the client, 
including **emails** and **information provided**. This does not include the transcripts
of meetings held with the client present, which are instead in the 
"Meeting Minutes".

* `Current Status`: contains key documents showing the current status of the
project; the **calendar** shows key upcoming dates, while the currrent work 
section contains a statement of the things that need to be done and areas of
priority up until the next update. Periodically updated as work progresses.
	
* `Meeting Minutes`: contains **minutes** for group meetings,
tutorials, and client meetings.

* `Previous Team Work`: this directory effectively contains the entirety of the
**previous group's repository** on this project, to be used as reference material
for our continuation of their work. The readme file within this repository
contains the contents and breakdown, in order to avoid oversaturating this file.

* `Project Deliverables`: this directory contains **techincal project documents**, **requirements** and
deliverables. Confidential documents are not available for viewing, however
a brief description is provided in the readme file. 

## Auditors Infomation

The readmes of the higher level folders will detail the contents of each folder. 
These are intended to make for ease of access. To get an understanding of what the most relevant files are, 
to save you time, go to: [Current Status Directory](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u5568225/GuidestarLaser/tree/master/Current_Status) 
and read the **Weekly_And_Audit_Summaries.pdf** file.  This will guide you through where to go, what to look at, and what they are.
