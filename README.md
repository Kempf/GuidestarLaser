## Description 

Readme: This file, contains contents showing the main directories of the
repository, as well as a description section, detailing what is in each of
these individual sections

Client Communications: Contains all one-way communication with the client, 
including emails and information provided. This does not include the transcripts
of meetings held with the client present, which are instead in the 
"Meeting Minutes".

Current Status: Contains key documents showing the current status of the
project; the calendar shows key upcoming dates, while the currrent work 
section contains a statement of the things that need to be done and areas of
priority up until the next update. Periodically updated as work progresses.

Meeting Minutes: Self explanatory, contains minutes for group meetings,
tutorials, and client meetings.

Previous Team Work: This directory effectively contains the entirety of the
previous group's repository on this project, to be used as reference material
for our continuation of their work. The readme file within this repository
contains the contents and breakdown, in order to avoid oversaturating this file.

Project Requirements: Updated in tandem with the "Current Status" directory, 
this contains the evolving project requirements in the main document, as well 
as comments and other updates that do not fit into the "Current Status".
